You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).
Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

Notice that you may not slant the container.

class Solution {
    public int maxArea(int[] height) {
        int left = 0;
        int right = height.length - 1;
        int max = 0;
        while(left < right){
            int w = right - left;
            int h = Math.min(height[left], height[right]);
            int area = h * w;
            max = Math.max(max, area);
            if(height[left] < height[right]) left++;
            else if(height[left] > height[right]) right--;
            else {
                left++;
                right--;
            }
        }
        return max;
    }
}
