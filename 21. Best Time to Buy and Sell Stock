You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        if(prices.length < 1 ) return 0;
        
        int min = prices[0]; int diff = 0; int max = 0;
        
        for(int i = 1; i < prices.length; i++){
            if(prices[i] < min) min = prices[i];
            diff = prices[i] - min;
            if(max < diff) max = diff;
        }
        
        return max;
    }
}
