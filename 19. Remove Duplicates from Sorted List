Given the head of a sorted linked list, delete all duplicates such that each element appears only once. Return the linked list sorted as well.

class Solution {
    public ListNode deleteDuplicates(ListNode head) {
        if(head == null || head.next == null)return head;
        head.next = deleteDuplicates(head.next);
        return head.val == head.next.val ? head.next : head;
    }
}
