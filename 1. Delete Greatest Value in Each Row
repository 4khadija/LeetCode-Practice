You are given an m x n matrix grid consisting of positive integers.

Perform the following operation until grid becomes empty:

Delete the element with the greatest value from each row. If multiple such elements exist, delete any of them.
Add the maximum of deleted elements to the answer.

### Solution
class Solution {
    public int deleteGreatestValue(int[][] grid) {
        int count = 0;
        int sum = 0;
        while (count <= grid[0].length) {
            int rowMax = 0;
            for (int i = 0; i < grid.length; i++) {
                int maxJ = 0;
                for (int j = 0; j < grid[i].length; j++) {
                    if (grid[i][j] >= grid[i][maxJ] && grid[i][j] != -1) {
                        maxJ = j;
                        if (grid[i][maxJ] > rowMax) {
                            rowMax = grid[i][maxJ];
                        }
                    }
                }
                grid[i][maxJ] = -1;
            }
            count++;
            sum += rowMax;
        }

        return sum;
        
    }
}
